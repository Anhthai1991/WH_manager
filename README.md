# Introduce yourself
Thank you for the opportunity to interview today.  

- My name is Nguyen Anh Thai, and I have more than 10 years of experience across transportation, warehouse operations, last-mile delivery, and supply chain project management.

- Most recently, I worked as a Center Operation Manager at UPS Vietnam, where I managed a team of 20 people and 12 trucks. My key responsibilities included daily route planning, productivity management, safety leadership, and ensuring service performance across the assigned territories. One of my proudest achievements was building a strong safety culture — “Safe by Choice, Not by Chance” — and maintaining excellent safety performance with structured training, incident investigations, and continuous improvement. 

- Before UPS, I worked as a Supply Chain Project Manager at Nguyen Kim. I led several end-to-end projects such as optimizing last-mile delivery, building inventory models, improving logistics cost visibility, and working closely with cross-functional teams to solve operational discrepancies. This role strengthened my analytical thinking, project execution capability, and ability to translate data into operational improvements.

- Earlier in my career at Avery Dennison, Auchan, and YCH (Suntory PepsiCo project), I gained a solid foundation in transportation management, 3PL coordination, KPI control, cost optimization, and customer service. Across these roles, I consistently focused on improving DIFOT, reducing logistics costs, and building strong partnerships with internal and external stakeholders. 

- My leadership style is coaching-oriented and data-driven. I believe in developing people, standardizing processes, and using KPIs and root-cause analysis to drive quality and efficiency. With my background in operations, safety, and supply chain optimization, I am confident that I can contribute to improving warehouse performance, service quality, and team capability in this role.

Thank you, and I look forward to discussing how I can add value to your organization.
