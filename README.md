# Introduce yourself
Thank you for the opportunity to interview today.  

- My name is Nguyen Anh Thai, and I have more than 10 years of experience across transportation, warehouse operations, last-mile delivery, and supply chain project management.

- Most recently, I worked as a Center Operation Manager at UPS Vietnam, where I managed a team of 20 people and 12 trucks. My key responsibilities included daily route planning, productivity management, safety leadership, and ensuring service performance across the assigned territories. One of my proudest achievements was building a strong safety culture — “Safe by Choice, Not by Chance” — and maintaining excellent safety performance with structured training, incident investigations, and continuous improvement. 

- Before UPS, I worked as a Supply Chain Project Manager at Nguyen Kim. I led several end-to-end projects such as optimizing last-mile delivery, building inventory models, improving logistics cost visibility, and working closely with cross-functional teams to solve operational discrepancies. This role strengthened my analytical thinking, project execution capability, and ability to translate data into operational improvements.

- Earlier in my career at Avery Dennison, Auchan, and YCH (Suntory PepsiCo project), I gained a solid foundation in transportation management, warehouse management, 3PL coordination, KPI control, cost optimization, and customer service. Across these roles, I consistently focused on improving OTIF, reducing logistics costs, optimize and ultilize warehouse operation and building strong partnerships with internal and external stakeholders. 

- My leadership style is coaching-oriented and data-driven. I believe in developing people, standardizing processes, and using KPIs and root-cause analysis to drive quality and efficiency. With my background in operations, safety, and supply chain optimization, I am confident that I can contribute to improving logistics & warehouse performance, service quality, and team capability in this role.

Thank you, and I look forward to discussing how I can add value to your organization.

## ⭐ 1. CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
### ❓ “Tell me about a time you handled conflict in your team.”
In one of my previous roles, I noticed a conflict between the picking and packing teams. 
Pickers believed packers were too slow, while packers complained about incorrect items coming from picking. 
This tension affected team morale and delayed shipments.

I first spoke with both groups separately to understand their concerns and reviewed data from our WMS to identify where issues happened. 
The root cause was unclear responsibilities and inconsistent adherence to SOPs.

To solve this, I redesigned the workflow with a clear handover process, created a 5-step checklist, and conducted training for both teams. 
I also implemented a short daily stand-up meeting to improve communication.

As a result, picking accuracy improved to 99.3%, on-time shipment increased to 97%, and the conflict ended. 
The teams became more collaborative and proactive in raising issues early.

This experience reinforced that most conflicts come from unclear processes, not from people.
## ⭐ 2. LEADERSHIP STYLE
### ❓ “How would you describe your leadership style?”
My leadership style is a combination of coaching and data-driven management.

From a coaching perspective, I focus on developing people through clear expectations, 1-on-1 conversations, and ongoing feedback. 
From a data perspective, I use KPIs, WMS dashboards, and root-cause analysis to ensure decisions are objective and fair.

I believe in empowering my team, creating accountability, and building a culture where people understand the ‘why’ behind the work. 
At UPS, this approach helped me improve performance and build a strong, safety-focused team.

Overall, my goal is to build a team that is competent, motivated, and capable of running daily operations smoothly even when I am not physically present.
## ⭐ 3. SAFETY MANAGEMENT
### ❓ “How do you ensure safety in warehouse operations?”
Safety is always my number one priority. I follow a structured approach:

1. Hazard identification – I walk the warehouse regularly, assess forklift zones, racking conditions, loading areas, and manual handling risks.
2. Clear safety standards – SOPs for forklift operation, PPE rules, and safe lifting guidelines must be followed 100%.
3. Training – I conduct regular safety training for all staff, including pre-shift briefings and refreshers.
4. Monitoring – Daily safety checks, forklift inspections, racking audits, and near-miss reporting.
5. Root-cause analysis after any incident – To prevent recurrence with corrective and preventive actions.

At UPS, we built a culture of “Safe by Choice, Not by Chance,” and achieved strong safety performance by combining training, strict compliance, and positive reinforcement.

My goal is always zero lost-time injuries.
## ⭐ 4. KPI MANAGEMENT
### ❓ “Which KPIs do you use to manage warehouse operations?”
I focus on KPIs that reflect accuracy, productivity, service, and safety. 
Some key KPIs I consistently monitor include:

- Inventory Accuracy  
- Picking/Packing Accuracy  
- On-time Shipment / DIFOT  
- Warehouse Throughput  
- Labor Productivity  
- Space Utilization  
- Shrinkage Rate  
- Safety KPIs (LTIR, near-miss reports, audit score)

I review these KPIs daily or weekly depending on the metric, and use them to identify gaps, coach the team, and drive continuous improvement.

For example, at UPS, we used daily route performance and productivity KPIs to optimize resource planning, reduce delays, and improve service quality.

## ⭐ 5. FAILURE / MISTAKE MANAGEMENT
### ❓ “Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake.”
In an earlier stage of my career, I underestimated the manpower required during a seasonal peak. 
As a result, outbound shipments were delayed for several hours on the first day.

I immediately took responsibility, reorganized manpower, requested temporary support, and communicated transparently with internal stakeholders.

After the peak season, I conducted a root-cause analysis and created a forecasting model that included volume trends, SKU mix, and historical peaks. 
This model allowed us to plan manpower accurately for the following years—resulting in smooth operations without any delays.

The experience taught me the importance of proactive planning and stress-testing operational scenarios, especially in warehouse and logistics environments.
## ⭐ 6. HANDLING UNDERPERFORMANCE
### ❓ “How do you deal with low-performing employees?”
I use a coaching-first approach.

First, I conduct a 1-on-1 conversation to understand the root cause—whether it’s skill, knowledge, motivation, or external issues. 
Then I set a clear improvement plan with measurable goals.

I provide training or assign a senior mentor to support them, and review progress weekly.

In most cases, performance improves significantly because people simply need clearer expectations and proper guidance. 
However, if there is no improvement after coaching and support, I move to formal disciplinary steps according to company policy.

This approach ensures fairness, maintains morale, and strengthens team capability.

## ⭐ 7. PRESSURE / HIGH-VOLUME OPERATIONS
### ❓ “How do you handle pressure during peak seasons?”
I handle pressure through preparation, structure, and communication.

Before peak periods, I forecast volume, review SKU characteristics, analyze historical data, and build manpower and equipment plans. 
I also conduct cross-training so staff can support multiple functions.

During peak days, I monitor KPIs in real time, reassign manpower quickly, and maintain constant communication among inbound, outbound, and transport teams.

This structured approach has allowed me to run high-volume operations smoothly while maintaining service levels and safety standards.

## ⭐ 8. CHALLENGING EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOR
### ❓ “What do you do if a team member refuses to follow SOP or safety rules?”
I address it immediately. Safety and SOP compliance are non-negotiable.

First, I speak privately with the employee to explain the risk, the expected behavior, and the consequences. 
If it’s a misunderstanding, I provide additional training.

If it is intentional or repeated, I escalate to disciplinary action because one unsafe behavior can put the entire warehouse at risk.

My approach is firm but fair: coaching first, correction second, and strict action if needed.

## ⭐ 9. IMPROVEMENT MINDSET
### ❓ “Describe a process improvement you led.”
At UPS, I optimized routing and manpower allocation by analyzing daily performance data. 
I identified inefficiencies in route planning and redesigned the structure with better cluster allocation.

This resulted in improved route productivity, reduced delays, and better service consistency. 
Additionally, I introduced a weekly performance dashboard that helped supervisors make faster decisions.

The improvement came from combining data analysis with frontline feedback.
